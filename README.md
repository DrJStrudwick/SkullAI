# SkullAI
 This git repo is for developing an AI to play the boardgame Skull. Note that I did not create the game, nor do i own any rights to it. I am simply creating an AI to play the game for the challenge.

 For those that have not played the game before you can watch a 5min how to play into [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv1_6AfbwlQ) . Ultimate its a social deduction/bluffing game. Players will take turn placing tiles and eventually start betting how many Flower tiles they believe they think they can find. If they do so correctly they gain a point, and the first to two points wins the game. However, if they find a skull tile before they find all the flower tiles they need, they stop, lose one of their tiles and the round begins again. Each player starts the game with 3 flower tiles and 1 skull tile.

 In this repo there is a Game Decision Flow file, which shows the flow diagram of a players decision throughout the game. (apologies for any incorrect shapes used). But the decisions that are coloured in yellow are the ones that we seek to have the "AI" make.
